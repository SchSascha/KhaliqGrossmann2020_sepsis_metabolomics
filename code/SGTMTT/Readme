This is a beta Matlab implementation
of Supervised Generative-Topographic-Mapping Through Time (SGTM-TT). 
tested with Matlab 2011a (R)

(C) 2010-2012 by Frank-Michael Schleif
fschleif@techfak.uni-bielefeld.de

It is also based on code of Ivan Olier 
ivan.olier@manchester.ac.uk
in the original GTM-TT implementation. 

The starting point is the GTMTT-Supervised.m
script and Demo.m as well as Demo2.m
Some simple test-data are included which
have been provided by Tien-ho Lin
thlin@microsoft.com

Limitations:
For simplicity and runtime issues the
code is modified such that all sequences
need to have equal length, but need not
to be aligned. The mapping may be less
useful than for regular GTM mappings because
the optimization is focused on discrimination
rather representation. Accordingly the mapping
is more like a constraint which is useful to
avoid model overfittings for small sample sizes.

Use this code on your own risk.
